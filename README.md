## Why and how it's been created:

Desiree will be going to Iceland and wants to know how to get events around the area as well as where to park when she gets there. Currently, different cities have their own specific websites to show the event going on their town. Google also shows events, but we want to create something that's more an all in one place for the info we need.

This is a project we created as a team. 
API's used:

## geocode
